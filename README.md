## Technical solutions of the application
Used technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB**.

### Styling
I have used **React Bootstrap** in all the elements of the application. Picture of the main page is from https://www.freepik.com/home. The home icon in the navigation bar is from https://fontawesome.com/.


## Pictures of the user interface

This is the view when the user opens the application.

Here the user can log in.

If the user wants to sign in to the application, they can click the "Rekister√∂idy" button in the log in window and then fill in their information to the fields that appear to the window.

After signing in, the user sees a message that the registeration has succeeded. If the registeration didn't succeed, the user sees a message of that.
